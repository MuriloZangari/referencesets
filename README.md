This repository is related to the manuscript: "A Decomposition-based Kernel of Mallows Models Algorithm for bi- and tri-objective Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem" submitted to Applied Soft Computing

Here we provide our best-known reference sets obtained by our algorithm called MEDA/D-MK for the Taillard PFSP benchmark with addition of due dates, proposed by Minella et al. (2008). The benchmark is available at http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances

The file MEDADMK_refsets_makespan_tt.tar.gz contains the best known results for the bi-objective PFSP minimizing makespan and total tardiness

The file MEDAD_refsets_makespan_tft_tt.tar.gz contains the best known results for the tri-objective PFSP minimizing makespan, total flowtime and total tardiness.
